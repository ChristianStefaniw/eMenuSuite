# eMenuSuite
This was my FIRST Flutter project so please excuse the messy codebase.  
Some stuff that I should have done better was state management (I didn't understand this concept back then), data deserailization (I didn't understand what data models were back then), and implemented a better project structure.  
I realize what I did incorrectly in this project and I fixed the gaps in my knowledge.  
Please see some of my more recent Flutter projects such as [MarkSpace](https://github.com/christianstefaniw/markspace-client).
Cheers!
